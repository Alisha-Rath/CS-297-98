<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p>
    This project aims to develop an AI-driven legal case prediction system capable of predicting legal case outcomes. By fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as DistilBERT with specialized datasets, we aim to predict whether the plaintiff or defendant will win the case based on provided facts. The system will integrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, DoRA, and QLoRA to improve model accuracy and computational efficiency. Additionally, explainable AI tools such as SHAP and LIME will be employed to provide transparency in the decision-making process, ensuring the system is both effective and ethically sound for real-world legal applications.
</p>

<h2>CS297 Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Laid the foundation for understanding supervised fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) by conducting an experimental study on a simple classification model using LoRA as the fine-tuning technique.</li>
    <li>Developed a legal case classification model leveraging a fine-tuned DistilBERT base model and LoRA for fine-tuning. We utilized the Supreme Court Judgment dataset from Kaggle, preprocessed the data, and trained the model to predict legal outcomes, achieving 68.4% accuracy. This dataset was chosen for its focus on case-specific predictions, making it more suitable for our purpose compared to other available legal case prediction datasets.</li>
    <li>Experimented with various parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA, DoRA, QLoRA) to optimize model performance. Using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, recall, and precision, we concluded that LoRA outperformed the others due to its ability to fine-tune simple classification models without significant loss of information, ensuring better training efficiency.</li>
    <li>Integrated explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and attention maps to improve model interpretability. By visualizing attention weights, we were able to understand how the model assigns importance to specific words and phrases in making predictions, providing insights into the underlying reasoning behind its outputs.</li>
</ul>
